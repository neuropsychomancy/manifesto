# The Neuropsychomancer Manifesto

Neuropsychomancy is the scientific art of integrating a large number of information in order to accurately predict a person's patterns of behaviours.

It is an applied branch of psychology focused on the existing correlationg between personality characteristics and other measurable features.

## Visualization

Neuropsychomancers use a bespoke visualization format that allows them to integrate and interpret a large number of information.

## Training

The goal of neuropsychomancy training is to develop hyper-precise priors allowing for a fast and efficient decision-making and conclusion-reaching. Importantly, these hyper-precise priors are themselves governed by another set of priors in a hierarchical fashion, allowing for the flexibility and subtlety required to reject and establish a new model if the evidence is inconclusive.
