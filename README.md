# The Neuropsychomancer Manifesto

Neurpsychomancy is the art of integrating a large number of information in order to accurately predict the behaviour (and likely future) of a person.

It is an applied branch of psychology focused on the correlates between personality and other measurable features.

## Visualization

Neuropsychomancers use a bespoke visualization format that allows them to integrate and interpret a large number of information.

## Training

The goal of neuropsychomancy training is to develop hyperprecise priors allowing for a fast decision making and conclusion-reaching. Importantly, these hyperprecise priors are themselves govnerned by another set of priors in a hierarchical fashion, allowing for the flexibility and subtely required to reject and establish a new model if the evidence is inconclusive.
